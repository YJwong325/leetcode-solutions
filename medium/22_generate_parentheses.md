# LeetCode 22: Generate Parentheses
[Problem statement on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

## Approach
Given a number, `n`, we would need to generate all possible combinations of `n` parentheses pairs. Correct combinations follow the following rules:

1. Number of open parentheses must be equal to the number of closed parentheses.
2. Closed parenthesis cannot be added without a corresponding open parenthesis before it.
3. Number of open parentheses and closed parentheses cannot exceed `n`.

In order to obey the rules stated above, we need variables to keep track of each number of closed (closedN) and open (openN) parentheses. While building a valid combination, we can simplify the problem down to 2 decisions. Either we add an open parenthesis, `'('`, or a closed parenthesis, `')'`.
